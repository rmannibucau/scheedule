= Environment

Configuration relies on DeltaSpike configuration but it is highly recommanded to set the values in
the dedicated table and not in system.properties for a real usage.

= Configuration

The application has a key-value configuration storage in a database integrated to deltaspike.

= Schedule tasks

Tasks can be CDI bean implementing `Runnable` like:

[source,java]
----
@Named
public class SampleTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Executed");
    }
}
----

When creating the scheduled task you can just reference it using its CDI name (`sampleTask`) or qualified class name if
it uses `@Default` qualifier.

= Cron syntax

Cron syntax uses 5 or 6 items with some shortcuts for:

- hourly
- daily
- weekly
- monthly
- annually
- never

otherwise you can use the syntaxes:

[source]
----
minute hour second dayOfMonth month dayOfWeek
----

or

[source]
----
minute hour dayOfMonth month dayOfWeek
----

The accepted values matches `ScheduleExpression` ones for the related fields.
